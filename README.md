Continuous Integration and Deployment with Jenkins

This project demonstrates the implementation of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines using Jenkins. The tasks involve configuring Jenkins Master-Slave architecture, building and deploying a Java Maven web application, and automating the CI/CD process using GitHub webhooks.

Project Overview

1. Jenkins Master-Slave Configuration

	•	Objective: Set up a Jenkins Master-Slave architecture and create a workspace on the Jenkins Slave Node using a Jenkins Free-style project.
	•	Outcome: Successfully configured a Master-Slave setup in Jenkins, enabling distributed builds and efficient resource management by delegating specific tasks to the Slave Node.

2. CI/CD Pipeline for Java Maven Web Application

	•	Objective: Create a CI/CD pipeline in Jenkins to clone a Java Maven web application from a Git repository and build it.
	•	Outcome: The pipeline was successfully created and executed, automating the build process for the Java Maven web application, ensuring continuous integration.

3. CI/CD Pipeline for Deployment to Tomcat Server

	•	Objective: Extend the CI/CD pipeline to deploy the built Maven web application to a Tomcat server.
	•	Outcome: The pipeline was enhanced to include deployment steps, automatically deploying the web application to the Tomcat server upon successful build completion.

4. Automating CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Webhook and Poll SCM

	•	Objective: Automate the CI/CD pipeline by integrating GitHub webhooks and configuring Poll SCM in Jenkins to trigger builds upon code changes.
	•	Outcome: The pipeline was fully automated, with builds triggered automatically whenever changes were pushed to the GitHub repository, ensuring continuous delivery.

Conclusion

This project highlights advanced skills in Jenkins, from setting up distributed build environments to creating and automating CI/CD pipelines. By integrating Jenkins with GitHub and Tomcat, this project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to continuous integration and deployment, essential for modern DevOps practices.
